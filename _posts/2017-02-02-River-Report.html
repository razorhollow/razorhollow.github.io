<h3><a href="http://www.douglastonsalmonrun.com/Fishing-Report.aspx">DSR Report</a></h3>
<p>Report Date: 2/1/17</p>
<p>The DSR Reports<br> <em>"A blustery day, with bands of lake effect snow squalls moving through, accompanied by strong gusts, throughout the day - water temperature 32, air in mid-30s, CFS 750 / 1060 - a client that fished the morning only, lower section of the river, went double-digits on Steelhead - two clients that left at 2:30 PM or so went 0 / 2 and 3 / 3 (also Steelhead), in the lower section - a client that left at 4:30 PM scored 4 / 6 Steelhead, fishing the lower section of the river, with a 10mm frosted tangerine bead pegged above an egg-sack, under a bobber - two of the last clients came in a little after 5:00 PM and reported a lot of fresh "chrome" fish, most over 10 #, in the lower section of the run - these are the same clients who went double-digits a few days ago and may have done so today as well - lake effect continues to be projected through Saturday, however clients are reporting that, except for some initial slush after a band of snow moves through, the water is clear and slush free - note: we are running a lodging special - $40 per person per night, any lodge, no minimum occupancy, until further notice - for those of you who have lodging reservations for the 2017 season, your deposit deadline is 5:00 PM on 15 February - those of you who may want to change dates, or want to book lodges, may want to call us to see what has opened up for immediate booking as we are reconciling with lodge clients in the next few weeks -

<p>Report Date: 2/2/2017</p>
<p>Whitakers Reports<br> <em>"On Wednesday the temperature reached into the low 30's and most of the day a heavy band of lake effect snow was set up over our area. We picked up roughly another foot of new snow and the chance of more lake effect snow is in the forecast over the next couple of days. Despite snow squalls and white out conditions at times anglers we had staying in the motel reported having a good day in the lower end of the river while float fishing with egg sacs and beads. In the afternoon my dad and I were watching the snow pile up and the temperature was in the 30's so we headed to the water. When we arrived at the DSR it was snowing like crazy and we thought what we were thinking. Everyone always tells us that you guys get to go whenever you want, well yesterday we went in a blizzard and were glad we did. We covered some water and landed several steelhead while float fishing with egg sacs."</em></p>
