<h3><a href="http://www.douglastonsalmonrun.com/Fishing-Report.aspx">DSR Report</a></h3>
<p>Report Date: 1/31/17</p>
<p>The DSR Reports<br> <em>"A handful of anglers fished the run today, they reported mixed success. Two anglers reported 7 hookups between the two of them, while the other two anglers had a single hook up. Slush was an issue until about mid morning (10am), and the trails along the river were a little difficult to navigate due to snow depth. We wont get as cold tonight as we did last night, the forecasted low is 22F. Temperatures tomorrow will rise to just above freezing with 1-3 inches of snow expected."</em></p>

<p>Report Date: 1/31/17</p>
<p>Whitakers Reports<br> <em>"On Tuesday we started out in the single digits but by the afternoon the temperature reached into the mid 20's. In the morning slush ice was a factor in the lower end of the river but it cleared around mid day. In the upper end of the river slush ice was not a factor. With the morning temperature in the single digits most anglers waited until late morning before hitting the water. At the end of the day we did not hear back from any anglers who stopped by earlier before heading to the water."</em></p>
