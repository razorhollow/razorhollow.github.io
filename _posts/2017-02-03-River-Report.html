<h2>Fishing Reports</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.douglastonsalmonrun.com/Fishing-Report.aspx">DSR Report</a></h3>
<p>Report Date: 2/2/17</p>
<p>The DSR Reports<br> <em>"Another blustery day on the Run, the first half of the day was relatively calm, but things turned windy in the afternoon with periodic white-outs. We've picked up another few inches of snow this afternoon. We had had 6 anglers fish the run today. Those I spoke with reported mixed success. One regular DSR angler had over a handful of hookups, another reported two steelies on the line. While two other anglers reported no action at all. The middle to lower section of the run seemed to be most productive today, but we will see what tomorrow brings. Pulaski is under a lake effect snow warning thru Saturday night, we are forecasted to get another 5-8 inches tonight, with lows near 20F. Tomorrow calls for an additional 3-5 inches, of course, it all depends where the lafe effect sets up. Feel free to give us a call for an update on current conditions."</em></p>

<p>Report Date: 2/2/2017</p>
<p>Whitakers Reports<br> <em>"On Wednesday the temperature reached into the low 30's and most of the day a heavy band of lake effect snow was set up over our area. We picked up roughly another foot of new snow and the chance of more lake effect snow is in the forecast over the next couple of days. Despite snow squalls and white out conditions at times anglers we had staying in the motel reported having a good day in the lower end of the river while float fishing with egg sacs and beads. In the afternoon my dad and I were watching the snow pile up and the temperature was in the 30's so we headed to the water. When we arrived at the DSR it was snowing like crazy and we thought what we were thinking. Everyone always tells us that you guys get to go whenever you want, well yesterday we went in a blizzard and were glad we did. We covered some water and landed several steelhead while float fishing with egg sacs."</em></p>
